      <h2 class="h2-daiel">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current
        , if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
      <p class="p-daniel">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”</p>
