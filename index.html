      <p class="h2-daiel">I received a job offer mid-course,and the subjects I learned were current,if not more so,in
        the company I joined.I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
      <p class="p-daniel">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course,I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”</p>
