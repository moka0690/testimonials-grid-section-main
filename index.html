        the company I joined.I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
      <p class="p-daniel">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have
        heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for the free intro course and found it
        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course,I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
        startup. ”</p>

      <p class="p-Patrick-Abrams">“The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
        The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an
        incredible community of smart and amazing people.”

      <p class="p-Kira-Whittle">
        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
        can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
        only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
        took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
